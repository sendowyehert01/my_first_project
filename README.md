<h1>For Examination</h1>
<p>my First Project</p>

<ol>
  <li>DL</li>
  <li>Run index.html</li>
</ol>

I made this as a HTML to display the result.
I compile also all the codes here to make it in a single file only.
For now, I dont know what are the best practices in coding because I dont have any experience yet. I will be hired maybe I will be better.
I am still studying more about Web Development esp. JS Frameworks to improve my coding skills and
study more about best practices in programming.
